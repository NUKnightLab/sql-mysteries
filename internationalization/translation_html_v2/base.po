msgid "There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime."

msgid "If you're comfortable with SQL, you can"
msgstr

msgid "skip these explanations"

msgid " A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a"

msgid "that occurred sometime on"
msgstr

msgid "Jan.15, 2018​"
msgstr

msgid "and that it took place in"
msgstr

msgid "SQL City"
msgstr

msgid ". Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database."
msgstr

msgid "All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use SQL to navigate through this vast network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database. Below well explain from a high level the commands you need to know; whenever you are ready, you can start adapting the examples to create your own SQL commands in search of clues -- you can run any SQL in any of the code boxes, no matter what was in the box when you started."
msgstr

msgid "Some Definitions"
msgstr

msgid "What is SQL?"
msgstr

msgid "SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a way to interact with relational databases and tables in a way that allows us humans to glean specific, meaningful information."
msgstr

msgid "Wait, what is a relational database?"
msgstr

msgid "There's no single definition for the word "
msgstr

msgid "database"
msgstr

msgid ". In general, databases are systems for managing information. Databases can have varying amounts of structure imposed on the data. When the data is more structured, it can help people and computers work with the data more efficiently."
msgstr

msgid "Relational databases are probably the best known kind of database. At their heart, relational databases are made up of "
msgstr

msgid "tables"
msgstr

msgid ", which are a lot like spreadsheets. Each column in the table has a name and a data type (text, number, etc.), and each row in the table is a specific instance of whatever the table is \"about.\" The \"relational\" part comes with specific rules about how to connect data between different tables."
msgstr

msgid "What is an ERD?"
msgstr

msgid "ERD, which stands for Entity Relationship Diagram, is a visual representation of the relationships among all relevant tables within a database. You can find the ERD for our SQL Murder Mystery database below. The diagram shows that each table has a name (top of the box, in bold), a list of column names (on the left) and their corresponding data types (on the right, in all caps). There are also some gold key icons, blue arrow icons and gray arrows on the ERD. A gold key indicates that the column is the ​primary key​ of the corresponding table, and a blue arrow indicates that the column is the foreign key​ of the corresponding table."
msgstr

msgid "Primary Key​:"
msgstr

msgid "a unique identifier for each row in a table."
msgstr

msgid "Foreign Key​:"
msgstr

msgid "used to reference data in one table to those in another table."
msgstr

msgid "If two tables are related, the matching columns, i.e. the common identifiers of the two tables, are connected by a gray arrow in the diagram."
msgstr

msgid "Here is the ERD for our database:"
msgstr

msgid "What is a query?"
msgstr

msgid "If you were to look at the data in this database, you would see that the tables are huge! There are so many data points; it simply isn’t possible to go through the tables row by row to find the information we need. What are we supposed to do?"
msgstr

msgid "This is where queries come in. Queries are statements we construct to get data from the database. Queries read like natural English (for the most part). Let's try a few queries against our database. For each of the boxes below, click the "run" to "execute" the query in the box. You can edit the queries right here on the page to explore further. (Note that SQL commands are not case-sensitive, but it's conventional to capitalize them for readability. You can also use new lines and white space as you like to format the command for readability. Most database systems require you to end a query with a semicolon (';') although the system for running them in this web page is more forgiving.)"
msgstr

msgid "What elements does a SQL query have?"
msgstr

msgid "A SQL query can contain:"
msgstr

msgid "SQL keywords (like the ​SELECT​ and ​FROM​ above)"
msgstr

msgid "Column names (like the ​name​ column above)"
msgstr

msgid "Table names (like the ​person​ table above)"
msgstr

msgid "Wildcard characters (such as "
msgstr

msgid "Functions"
msgstr

msgid "Specific filtering criteria"
msgstr

msgid "Etc"
msgstr

msgid "SQL Keywords"
msgstr

msgid "SQL keywords are used to specify actions in your queries. SQL keywords are not case sensitive, but we suggest using all caps for SQL keywords so that you can easily set them apart from the rest of the query. Some frequently used keywords are:"
msgstr

msgid "SELECT​ allows us to grab data for specific columns from the database:"
msgstr

msgid "*​ (asterisk): it is used after ​SELECT​ to grab all columns from the table;"
msgstr

msgid "column_name(s): to select specific columns, put the names of the columns after SELECT​ and use commas to separate them."
msgstr

msgid "FROM​ allows us to specify which table(s) we care about; to select multiple tables, list the table names and use commas to separate them. (But until you learn the JOIN keyword, you may be surprised at what happens. That will come later.)"
msgstr

msgid "The ​WHERE​ clause in a query is used to filter results by specific criteria."
msgstr

msgid "Let's try some of these things."
msgstr

msgid "The ​AND​ keyword is used to string together multiple filtering criteria so that the filtered results meet each and every one of the criteria. (There's also an OR keyword, which returns rows that match any of the criteria.)"
msgstr

msgid "If you haven't found the right crime scene report yet, click \"show solution\" above, and replace the contents of the box with just the revealed command. (Leave out the initial "
msgstr

msgid " If you figured out the query that shows the single crime scene report instead of a few for the same city and type, then congratulations and disregard the word \"incorrect\". You'll know if you got it!"
msgstr

msgid "Wildcards and other functions for partial matches"
msgstr

msgid "Sometimes you only know part of the information you need. SQL can handle that. Special symbols that represent unknown characters are called \"wildcards,\" and SQL supports two. The most common is the"
msgstr

msgid "wildcard."
msgstr

msgid "When you place a"
msgstr

msgid "wildcard in a query string, the SQL system will return results that match the rest of the string exactly, and have anything (or nothing) where the wildcard is. For example,"
msgstr

msgid "matches"
msgstr

msgid "and"
msgstr

msgid "California"
msgstr

msgid "The other, less commonly used wildcard, is"
msgstr

msgid "This one means 'match the rest of the text, as long as there's exactly one character in exactly the position of the"
msgstr

msgid "no matter what it is. So,"
msgstr

msgid "would match"
msgstr

msgid " but not"
msgstr

msgid "or"
msgstr

msgid "Important:"
msgstr

msgid "When using wildcards, you don't use the"
msgstr

msgid "symbol; instead, you use"
msgstr

msgid "SQL also supports numeric comparisons like"
msgstr

msgid "(less than) and"
msgstr

msgid "(greater than). You can also use the keywords"
msgstr

msgid "and all of those work with words as well as numbers."
msgstr

msgid "We've mentioned that SQL commands are not case-sensitive, but"
msgstr

msgid "querie values for"
msgstr

msgid "are. Sometimes you don't know how the text is stored in the database. SQL provides a couple of functions which can smooth that out for you. They're called"
msgstr

msgid "and you can probably figure out what they do, especially if you explore in the box below."
msgstr

msgid "Sometimes the questions you want to ask aren’t as simple as finding the row of data that fits a set of criteria. You may want to ask more complex questions such as “Who is the oldest person?” or “Who is the shortest person?”""
msgstr

msgid "Aggregate functions"
msgstr

msgid "can help you answer these questions. In fact, you learned an aggregate function above,"
msgstr

msgid "How old is the oldest person with a drivers license? With a small amount of data, you might be able to just eyeball it, but there thousands of records in the "
msgstr

msgid "drivers_license"
msgstr ""

msgid "if you want to know just how many!) You can't just look over that list to find the answer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are a few useful aggregate functions SQL provides:"
msgstr ""

msgid "finds the maximum value"
msgstr ""

msgid "finds the minimum value"
msgstr ""

msgid "calculates the sum of the specified column values"
msgstr ""

msgid "calculates the average of the specified column values"
msgstr ""

msgid "counts the number of specified column values"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's another way to find minimum and maximum values, while also seeing more of the data. You can control the sort order of results you get. It's really quite intuitive: just use"
msgstr ""

msgid "followed by a column name. It can be challenging when there's a lot of data! (When people get serious about working with SQL, they use better tools than this web-based system!) By default, ORDER BY goes in \"ascending\" (smallest to largest, or A to Z) order, but you can be specific with"
msgstr ""

msgid "for ascending, or you can reverse it with"
msgstr ""

msgid "By now, you know enough SQL to identify the two witnesses. Give it a try!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Making connections"
msgstr ""

msgid "Joining tables"
msgstr ""

msgid "Until now, we’ve been asking questions that can be answered by considering data from only a single table. But what if we need to ask more complex questions that simultaneously require data from two different tables? That’s where ​JOIN​ comes in."
msgstr ""

msgid "More experienced SQL folks use a few different kinds of JOIN -- you may hear about INNER, OUTER, LEFT and RIGHT joins. Here, we'll just talk about the most common kind of JOIN, the INNER JOIN. Since it's common, you can leave out INNER in your SQL commands."
msgstr ""

msgid "The most common way to join tables is using primary key and foreign key columns. Refer back to the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) above if you don't remember what those are, or to see the key relationships between tables in our database. You can do joins on any columns, but the key columns are optimized for fast results. It is probably easier to show how joins work with our interactive SQL system than to write them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sometimes you want to connect more than one table. SQL lets you join as many tables in a query as you like."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now that you know how to join tables, you should be able to find the interview transcripts for the two witnesses you identified before. Give it a try!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Go Get 'em!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now you know enough SQL to solve the mystery. You'll need to read the ERD and make some reasonable assumptions, but there's no other syntax that you need!"
